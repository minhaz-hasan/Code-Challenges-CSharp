Q:  In part 2 you calculated the average of all the reviews. We call this number the 
	TrustScore. In reality the formula for the TrustScore is more complex. The goal of 
	the TrustScore is to predict what score the next review will give the webshop. With 
	this in mind do you have any ideas on how to improve the formula? You don’t have to 
	implement your ideas, just explain it in text.


A: Not really, but based on the reviews of the pages I think google prediction api is a good choice.
   It uses two very good numerical analysis models regression and categorization. And I think this api is 
   a good fit for prediction because the training data based on ratings of customers, most effective meaning of their comments 
   e.g. "Excellent" or "Terrible", scores of previous sessions. And I think regression numerical analyzer can calculate numerical
   value of the prediction(Although I never use it). But I guess it's a good option and another way you can improve your formula by implementing
   Bayessian probability theory or effective prediction and forcasting algorithms like markov chain algorithm I think.
